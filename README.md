## Important Notes

I created this site containing 7 different projects with GSAP from beginner to professional level by myself while following Enzo Ustariz's training [available here](https://www.ecole-du-web.net/p/cours-gsap)

Please remember I didn't focus on style or responsiveness but on the use of GSAP with REACT

You can finds projetct's code in src/screens/project/

All the site is in english, please remember I'm french so I apologize in advance for any language errors.

## Available Commands

First clone the project with : `git clone`

Then `cd gsap`

You can now run the following commands in the projects :

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
